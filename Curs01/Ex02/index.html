  <p> When talking about digital product design, user onboarding refers to the process of guiding new users through your
    product with the goal of demonstrating its value

  </p>
  <p>Overly complicated onboarding is a quick way to turn off new users of your app. By keeping onboarding as simple as
    possible, you increase the likelihood of users finishing the onboarding process.

  </p>
  <p>
    Consider which elements of your app you can skip during the onboarding process. You donâ€™t have to introduce every
    feature and function during the initial onboarding. Stick to the basic functionality users will need to get started
    with the app.
